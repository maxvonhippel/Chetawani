# Chetawani
An open source project to bring recovery tools to iOS for disaster relief in Nepal following the April 25 2015 earthquake.

Please fork the project and improve it in any way possible.  I will accept improvements from others and push them.  Any work on this app
is purely of a volunteer nature, but I will give credit where it is due.

My TODO list:
-Migrate from a UIWebView of the map to an MKMapView with XML parsing of OSM data
-Add layers on map for USGS, Ushahidi conflict and other information
-Add more social networking resources
  -Add facebook tool to tell friends you are OK
  -Add Contact the Developer tool, use external email 
-Use ReadKit to make RSS parsing actually be PARSING and not just presentation of website
